# 381-stockprediction
## 381: Intro to Python Programming - Project

The program that allows you to view company data from all tickers using YH Finance API and extract stock data for a given time frame into a csv file. 
The program uses Deep Learning techniques of RNN, Recurrent Neural Networks, to train a LSTM, long short-term memory, model to generate a prediction model and forecast the following days stock price.

The following day's predicted stock price will output to the console, upon closing the graph. The user has the option to retrieve data and prediction models for various stocks until chosen to exit program.
